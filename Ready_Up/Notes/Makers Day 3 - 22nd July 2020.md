_Things I have learned today_

**REPL (or ‘Read–Evaluate–Print Loop’)**

Procedure - step by step set of instructions that the program follows. Similar to a recipe.

Variables can’t be read outside the file they’re written in, but constants can be. Constants are usually written capitalised.

Conditional procedures depend on the outcome of a **condition**.

True and false are used to do logic: often, to manage the control flow.

Everything between do and end is a procedure.
