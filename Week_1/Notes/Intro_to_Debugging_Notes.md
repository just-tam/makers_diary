# Notes from Intro to Debugging Workshop

**What is a bug?**

 - A piece of code that doesn't work as expected
 - errors within the code

**What is Debugging?**

  - Process of eliminating bugs from expected program output
  - Should be focused on finding bugs and seeing what is happening

**What is the Debugging Mantra?**

 - "Tighten the loop, get visibility."

**Stancetrace** - Error lines that give information about the coding errors

**Syntax Error** - Can't recognise files as ruby

**Runtime Error** - Creates stancetraces after executing code

Types of errors examples:
- NoMethodError, undefined method
- Wrong number of arguments
- syntax errors

Identifying errors
- Use "p" to print bits of code to see/test what's happening within the code
